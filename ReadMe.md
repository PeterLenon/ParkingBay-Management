## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python (any version -- hopefully the latest version at the time of reading this file)
- Python library - cv2
- Python library - cvzone
- Python library - pickle
- Python library - numpy 
  
### Installation

1. Choose and install the code Editor of your choice
2. Install python on machine from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Ensure pip is installed with the command: python -m ensurepip --upgrade
4. Install libraries using: python -m pip install <library_name_here>

## Usage

- In main.py using the OpenCV library, the script marks all the positions of interest with the draw rectangle method. Then using the coordinates of the rectangle, crop out each area of interest, apply blurr, canny images and image dilation to enlarge the lightened pixel concentration
to determine if that particular parking bay is occupied or not
- CarPark POS is a binary file that stores all the locations of the positions of interest in the frame
- When footage is played the script checks if white pixel concentration exceeds a set threshold to determine if the bay is occupied or not
