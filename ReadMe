This project is an implementation of computer vision to manage parking bays. 
The project is writte complete;y written in python.
I used the openCV library to mark all the positions of interest with the draw frectangle method
Then using the coordinates of the rectangle cut crop out each area of interest, apply blurr, canny images and image dilation to enlarge the lightened pixel concentration
to determine if that particular parking bay is occupied or not

CarPark POS is a binary file that stores all the location of the positions of interest in the frame
When a footage is played then the script checks if white pixel concentration exceeds a set thershhold to determine if the bay is occupied or not
